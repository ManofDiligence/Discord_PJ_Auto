# A simple program using Python to send the message
# How does it work?
- Using the post method to request the discord's server and the server will process this request and help us send the message
- Sending messages using the token-based method (the authorization of a discord account)
- The program can send multiple msg at a time but also set the interval between each message
- Also the program has a human margin that inserts some randomness into the interval
- Making it a human-like look when sending a msg

# Current Problems
- Even though added the human margin stuff, the discord ac is still gets banned after a long period of time sending out our msgs(1 or 2 days).
- Still figure out if it has a bot using some algorithm to detect us or if someone finds our msgs annoying sometimes and reports us
- The channel won't let us come back even if I create a new ac to get into again.
- At this moment, I know that my IP address is blacklisted......

# Any Solution?
- I am going to create a proxy server to send the post request in the upcoming weeks.
- what is a proxy? => https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BB%A3%E7%90%86%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%99%A8
- The proxy will help us to hide our real IP, and all I need to do is open up my VPN, get into the channel again
- and do our old job within a proxy server.

# What if the IP of the proxy server gets banned again?
- That's a really good question!
- And the only solution I can think of is to use a different Proxy (IP) for sending each msg.
# please let me know if you guys have another method to solve this problem
